# Instructions  
To set up and use the project locally, first make sure you have git installed on your system.  
  
From there, in the repository, click the green "Clone or download" button and copy the link it displays.  
  
Then, open your system's command prompt, navigate to the folder you want your local repository

repository for you where the HTML and Javascript can be changed and interacted with.
